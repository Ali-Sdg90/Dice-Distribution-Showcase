<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    React-Dice-Distribution is a visually appealing web application built with
    React that showcases dice distribution in a graphical form. The app includes
    a control panel where users can manipulate the number of dice (ranging from
    2 to 30), the delay between each dice deployment, and the number of times
    the dice are thrown in a single step. The user can set these parameters and
    initiate the dice rolling process by clicking the "Start" button. The sums
    of the dice numbers are then displayed on a responsive chart.
</p>
<p>
    The chart, implemented using the ApexCharts library, provides an immersive
    experience with features such as zoom, responsiveness, smooth animations,
    and transitions. Additionally, the chart offers export options, allowing
    users to save it in SVG, PNG, or CSV formats.
</p>
<p>
    The application's meticulous attention to detail and high level of
    craftsmanship is evident. It has been designed to ensure a seamless user
    experience on devices of varying sizes, thanks to a custom responsive design
    that includes scaling and rotation capabilities. You can access the app on
    GitHub Pages using the following link:

        >React-Dice-Distribution</a
    >.
</p>
<p>
    The chart visualizes the data in a line format, displaying the line of all
    accumulated dice sums. This representation facilitates the identification of
    a normal distribution or bell curve. The dark theme employed in the app
    contributes to enhanced readability and reduced eye strain.
